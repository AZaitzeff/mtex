%% *|S2FunHarmonic|*
%
% |S2FunHarmonic| is the heart of |S2Fun|, therefore much effort is put into its functionality.
% This functionality can be best represented if we split the documentation into parts.
%
% <basicFunction_univariate.html The first part> covers the features for univariate functions.
% In <basicFunction_multivariate.html the second part> we consicer multivariate functions and generalize the functionality of the first part to higher dimensions.
